_this post is still work in progress it will be updated often in the future_

## Tools

- [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/): _"ML algorithms and utilities"_
-  [DL4J](http://deeplearning4j.org): _"Deeplearning4j lets you compose deep neural nets from various shallow nets, each of which form a so-called `layer`. This flexibility lets you combine variational autoencoders, sequence-to-sequence autoencoders, convolutional nets or recurrent nets as needed in a distributed, production-grade framework that works with Spark and Hadoop"._
- [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html) : _"Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It contains tools for data preparation, classification, regression, clustering, association rules mining, and visualization."_
- [MOA (Massive On-line Analysis)](https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/details/). _"MOA is a framework for data stream mining. It includes tools for evaluation and a collection of machine learning algorithms."_
- [Elki](https://elki-project.github.io): _"ELKI is an open source (AGPLv3) data mining software written in Java. The focus of ELKI is research in algorithms, with an emphasis on unsupervised methods in cluster analysis and outlier detection"_
- [Java Statistical Analysis Tool](https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT/tree/master): _"JSAT is a library for quickly getting started with Machine Learning problems."_.  [List of algorithms.](https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT/wiki/Algorithms)
- [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/): _"Encog supports a variety of advanced algorithms, as well as support classes to normalize and process data. Machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models, Genetic Programming and Genetic Algorithms are supported."_
- [Tensorflow Java API](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_java): _"TensorFlow provides a Java APIâ€” particularly useful for loading models created with Python and running them within a Java application."_
- [Apache SAMOA](http://samoa.incubator.apache.org): _"Apache SAMOA is a distributed streaming machine learning (ML) framework that contains a programing abstraction for distributed streaming ML algorithms."_

### Computer Vision
- [BoofVC](http://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Main_Page): _"BoofCV is an open source library written from scratch for real-time computer vision. Its functionality covers a range of subjects, low-level image processing, camera calibration, feature detection/tracking, structure-from-motion, fiducial detection, and recognition."_

### NLP
- [openNLP](http://opennlp.apache.org): _"OpenNLP supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, language detection and coreference resolution."_
- [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk): _"GATE is an open source software toolkit capable of solving almost any text processing problem"._
- [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu): _"MALLET is a Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text."_
