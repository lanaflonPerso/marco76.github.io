## use the framework

(work in progress)

This page will explain how to use our 'standard' tools to easily build modern web applications.

We are using:

- Java EE / Jakarta EE for the backend development
- HTML 5 / Javascript (ES 6) / CSS 3 for the frontend
- Payara 5 and Jelastic for the deployment

The target of this description are start-up and companies with one or few products that don't want to create a gas factory with useless frameworks.

# no frameworks? kubernetes?

Often we build too complicated solutions that don't last long.

We try to avoid Angular and React. In my professional experience Angular has been super productive until when one of the component didn't break (upgrade).

For the public website SPA are not good enough. S.E.O. problems, performances etc.

Javascript is very good for applications with 'normal' complexity.

Kubernetes and similar are very good when you have hundreds of projects and 2 or 3 full time administrators. For product oriented companies is expensive and not productive.
