# Av Components

I'm building some custom components based on Angular material with the goal to speed the development of applications REST based.

You can have a preview of the Autocomplete and Chip here:

# AV Table
Will follow a Table component that receives a simple array and allows the developer to visually customize the rendering and helps in some common operations as Create, Delete, Update.

A first demo is coming in the next days.
